# Hello_World
### First repository and activity on Github
##### My name is **Nicolas Hribar**, I am a current sophomore at the time of writting this code
>I used to code in highschool but decided to not persue a Comp sci major after doing bad in first class
##### My goal is to learn how to use GitHub to present all of my projects
##### * *I hope to learn how to develop skills sets that work hand in hand with GitHub* *
